Localization Tool is made for Google Apps Script and helps managing strings for Android and iOS localized apps.

The tool runs as an addon for Google Spreadsheet and creates an extra menu option with the following options: "Import Android/iOS" files and "Generate Localization Files". With those options, you can fill the spreasheet based on your localization file and/or create the localization files (Android's strings.xml and iOS Localizable.string) based on the data from the spreadsheet.
